# linux-surface for Arch Linux linux-lts kernel

- Currently based on Arch Linux linux-lts kernel 4.19.x

- Intended for **Surface Book 1 (especially, with Performance Base)** and **Surface 3**, but all patches (or equivalent) from [jakeday repository](https://github.com/jakeday/linux-surface) are applied

- PKGBUILD is from [core/linux-lts](https://git.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git/log/trunk?h=packages/linux-lts)
	- `linux.preset` is modified not to create fallback initramfs. If you need it, rename `linux.preset.orig` to `linux.preset`



## How to build

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/kitakar5525/arch-kernel-linux-lts419-surface
cd arch-kernel-linux-surface
makepkg -sC
```
